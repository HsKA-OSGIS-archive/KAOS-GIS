/**
 * ShowRedliningToolsContainerController
 *
 * This controller will be used to manage the redlining tools in the GIS
 * application. Actually the following actions/tools are supported:
 *  * Draw point
 *  * Draw line
 *  * Draw polygon
 *  * Draw post-it
 *  * Move object
 *  * Copy object
 *  * Modify object
 *  * Delete object
 *  * Style object (simple styling of points, lines and polygons. No images as
 *    point icon are supported at the moment).
 * The controller is based on the logic of BasiGX.view.container.Redlining
 * class, which was adapted to match the MVVC structure better.
 *
